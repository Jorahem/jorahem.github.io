Hello — I’m Hem Bahadur Jora, a BIM student from Dhangadhi, Nepal, passionate about building clean, functional, and responsive web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into real projects, learning new technologies, and improving my skills through hands-on work.

I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, and I love exploring tools that make development faster and more enjoyable. I’m constantly working on new projects that help me grow as a developer and understand how real systems are built.

I’ve built multiple projects, including an Online Food Ordering System developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, featuring item browsing, cart management, and order submission. I previously worked as a computer technician at NCC Computers, which strengthened my problem-solving skills and practical understanding of hardware/software systems.

I’ve also completed several bootcamps and training programs in AI, cloud computing, and app development, which helped me broaden my technical perspective.

Beyond coding, I enjoy playing football, learning new tools, and exploring creative ideas. I’m always open to collaboration, conversations, and opportunities that help me grow.
